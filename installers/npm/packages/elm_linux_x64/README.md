# Elm Binary for Linux (x64)

Some people install [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) with `npm`. This package helps make [`npm install elm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm) work smoothly.

The official binaries are published via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/elm/compiler/releases), but this package allows the typical `npm install elm` command to download the relevant binary directly from npm. This makes installation a bit faster and a bit more reliable.
